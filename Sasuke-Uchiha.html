              <h2>Sasuke Uchiha</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                Naruto Uzumaki, as implied by his name, is the main protagonist of the Naruto anime and manga series. At the onset of the series, Naruto is revealed to be the container of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox, which nearly destroyed his village twelve years prior to the onset of the current plot. Masashi Kishimoto, the creator of the Naruto series, was greatly inspired by Akira Toriyama (the creator of the Dragonball series). As such, Naruto's demeanor and appearance somewhat mirrors that of Goku, the main character of the Dragonball series. Nevertheless, Naruto has become a hit character in his own right in the anime and manga industry.

              <h2>Appearance</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                Sasuke Uchiha is the sole survivor of the legendary Uchiha Clan, whose members were all massacred about six years prior to the onset of Naruto's main plot. 
                He also serves as Naruto's main rival and somewhat of the antihero as the plot progresses. In Part I, Sasuke is a recently graduated genin ninja who participates in missions as a member of Team 7, 
                whose other members are Naruto, Sakura, and team leader Kakashi. Towards the end of Part I, he defects from Konoha and trains with Orochimaru in order to fulfill his goal of defeating Itachi, Sasuke's older brother. 
                In Part II, Sasuke, recruiting three other ninjas he met during his training, forms a team and begins his pursuit of Itachi.

              <h2>Personality</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                Having dedicated his life to defeating his brother, Sasuke throughout the series maintains cold and unsociable behavior. 
                However, he began to show more compassion towards others, particularly his teammates, due to Naruto's positive influence. 
                As a result, the drive to accomplish his goal began to decrease over time until he encountered his brother the second time. 
                Realizing the gap between his and Itachi's power, in addition to Naruto quickly surpassing him in strength, Sasuke became increasingly antagonistic and obstinate. 
                Driven by his thirst for power, he emotionally detached himself and became even colder and unsympathetic than he was originally. 
                Two and a half years later, Sasuke's personality remains the same, showing no interest in anything but the advancement of his training, and being stubborn and pretentious towards his peers and superiors alike. 
                He rarely shows any emotion and generally carries a serious or cold look on his face. He also seems to be more peevish and aggressive, and will quickly resolve to using force if needed.

                <h2>Abilites</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Sasuke, being a descendant of the Uchiha, has been able to use fire techniques as well as weapon based techniques even prior to his attendance at the ninja academy. 
                    Additionally, he is highly intelligent and a quick learner, mastering basic and advanced ninja techniques in a short amount of time. Sasuke, like his brother, has often been labeled as a prodigy 
                    and number one rookie ninja, graduating the ninja academy at the top of his class. During the Chūnin Exams, Sasuke was taught Chidori by Kakashi. Initially, his limit for using that technique was two shots a day--three 
                    if he uses the cursed seal. After his training with Orochimaru, Sasuke seems to have overcome this weakness and uses Chidori regularly in battle. In Part II, Sasuke is able to use summoning techniques as well as Orochimaru's variant of the replacement technique. 
                    He also employs a new variant of Chidori, called Chidori Nagashi (lit. One-Thousand Birds Current), as well as others in which he uses shape manipulation to change the nature of the technique's use. He also often sends an electrical current through his weapons, primarily his chokutō, to significantly increase their sharpness. 
                    Furthermore, he creates a new fire technique called Fire Release: Great Dragonfire Technique (Katon: Gōryūka no Jutsu), which he uses to prepare for his strongest technique he created called Kirin (Qilin).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Cursed Seal Of Heaven</h3>
                    <br>
                    During the Chūnin Exams in Part I, Orochimaru branded Sasuke with the cursed seal of heaven. The cursed seal increases the user's chakra reserve by forcibly drawing out chakra, 
                    thus augmenting their strength, speed, and abilities. However, extended use of the cursed seal will slowly deteriorate the user's personality and ability to reason, eventually 
                    turning him/her into a mindless killer. When activated, Sasuke's body is covered with black "curse" marks and can use senjutsu. When activating the second level, the marks envelop Sasuke's body, 
                    turning his skin color to a dark tan. His hair becomes long and wild and light blue in color, and the sclera of his eyes turn black. A black star mark forms on Sasuke's nose, and two wings grow out of his back. 
                    One of the wings were damaged in Sasuke's fight with Deidara, and were thus replaced with snakes. In a later duel with Itachi, he lost the second wing to the black flames of Amaterasu, after which point the wings no longer formed when Sasuke entered level two. 
                    Originally, Sasuke was discouraged to use the cursed seal, primarily by Kakashi who put a seal on it to prevent it from spontaneously activating itself. Following his defection from Konoha, he made regular use of the curse mark, even becoming able to partially transform into level two so as to conserve chakra. 
                    However, after Itachi killed Orochimaru, the cursed seal disappeared.

                    <h3>Kekkei Genkai: Sharingan, Mangekyo Sharingan, and Rinnegan</h3>
                    <br>
                    As the descendant of the Uchiha, Sasuke is able to use the Sharingan, a bloodline technique exclusive to members of the Uchiha clan. 
                    He is first seen using it in a battle against Haku and Zabuza, however, it is revealed in Part II that he first awakened it the night Itachi massacred the Uchiha clan. 
                    Though initially incomplete, Sasuke is able to employ some of the Sharingan's basic abilities, such as tracking fast moving objects and reading techniques. 
                    He was able to copy Rock Lee's Hidden Lotus using his Sharingan, creating his own variant of the move he named the Lion Combo. In Sasuke's final fight with Naruto in Part I, 
                    he fully matured his Sharingan, which is characterized by having three tomoe in each eye. In Part II, Sasuke is able employ all of the Sharingan's abilities, including casting powerful genjutsu.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before his death, Itachi implanted his Amaterasu into Sasuke initially set to trigger upon the sight of Madara Uchiha's Sharingan. Afterwards, due to Itachi's death, 
                    Sasuke came to possess his own Mangekyou Sharingan as well as the ability to cast and dispel the fires of Amaterasu. In addition to Amaterasu, Sasuke's Mangekyou allows him to force his opponent to reveal his/her thoughts. 
                    Furthermore, it also allows him to cast some sort of illusion similar to Tsukuyomi in which the victim experiences a vision of his/her death.

                    Moments after the Kage Meeting at the Summit, Danzou then left the area to escape from those who are trying to find out his real identity until tracked my Sasuke. 
                    He and Danzou engaged into a fearsome battle until Sasuke unleashed of another power given to him by Itachi: Susanoo. Susanoo is the God of the Sea and Storms. 
                    This great Jjutsu is generated from both eyes. Susanoo appears to hold a sword and shield; the sword is created from the sake in the gourd. the sword is the default ability of the sword; 
                    it has the power to seal away anyone who is caught in its wrath into oblivion until the end of time. The shield can be used to go against any attack. The sword and shield together makes the user practically invincible. 
                    Though Susanoo is a very dangerous ability, where as it affects the user's health and especially the user's eyes.

                    <br>
                    After obtaining his Mangenkyou Sharingan, Sasuke began losing his eyesight (the side effect). At first, he refuses to take his dead brother's Itachi's sharingan but after Sasuke's encounter with Naruto later on, 
                    he finally accepts the eyes. With this, Sasuke's Sharingan will make another transformation. This is referred to as "obtaining the light". The new sharingan is named the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After receiving half of the Sage of the Six Paths' power, Sasuke awakens a Rinnegan with six tomoe in his left eye. Sasuke is able to use the Six Paths, control the Tailed Beasts, 
                    utilize Space - Time Ninjutsu, and use his Sharingan and Mangekyou Sharingan powers.

                    <h3>Summoning Technique</h3>
                    <br>
                    During his training with Orochimaru he uses the summoning technique to summon snakes. After the fight with Itachi, though, he began using Hawk Summoning instead.

                    <br>
                    <h3>Nature Transformation</h3>
                    <br>
                    Sasuke's nature specialty is in lightning and fire. In addition, he has demonstrated the ability to manipulate the flames of Amaterasu through Blaze Release. He is also able to use Yin Release through genjutsu and 
                    had some experience with Yang Release through the Cursed Seal of Heaven. After obtaining the Six Paths Yin Power from the Sage of the Six Paths, he is able to utilize Yin-Yang Release. Sasuke has learned Wind, Earth, 
                    and Water Release as well.

                    <h3>Katana</h3>
                    <br>
                    In Part 2(Naruto Shippuden), Sasuke began carrying a katana. He uses this katana in many different ways. His favorite use is to run an electric chakra current through the sword. By doing this he is able to cut through metal 
                    and paralyze the foe if impaled to the body.
